# qrts

QR Code&trade; encoding in TypeScript with no additional dependencies.

```typescript
import { generate } from "qrts";

const qrcode = generate("foo bar baz");
```

# API

## generate

```typescript
generate(data: string|string[], options?: Partial<GenerateOptions>): QRCode
```

### params

- **data** text to be encoded in the QR Code.

  If an array of strings is passed, then they will be encoded in turn.

  For each string that is encoded, either the `ALPHA_NUMERIC` or `8BIT_BYTE` mode will be used to encode it. The `NUMERIC` and `KANJI` modes are not supported. If the contents can be encoded using `ALHPA_NUMERIC`, then that will be used, otherwise the string will be encoded as `UTF-8` and the `8BIT_BYTE` mode will be used.

- **options** (optionally) configures the QR Code generation.
  ```typescript
  interface GenerateOptions {
    version: number;
    errorCorrectionLevel: ErrorCorrectionLevel;
  }
  ```
  - **version** a number between 1 and 40 that specifies how large the QR Code should be. The size of the generated code will be 4 Ã— version + 17. If this is not specified, or set to `-1`, then the smallest size capable of containing the data will be used.
  - **errorCorretionLevel** &mdash; This is one of `Low`, `Medium`, `Quartile`, or `High`, representing increasing levels of redundancy in the QR Code. This will default to `High`.

### returns

This returns a `QRCode` object which has the following interface

```typescript
interface QRCode {
  size: number;
  isDark: (row: number, col: number) => boolean;
  isPatternModule: (row: number, col: number) => boolean;
}
```

- **size** the size of the QR Code in modules. The code will always be square.
- **isDark** Indicates whether a specific module is dark.
- **isPatternModule** Indicates whether a specific module is one of the corner blocks used by readers to locate and orient the QR Code

That package has been forked, converted to TypeScript, and modernized. In addition, support has been added for the `ALPHA_NUM` mode allowing smaller codes in some circumstances.
